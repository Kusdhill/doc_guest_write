# doc_guest_write
This program was written for the Event Strategy Office at UC Santa Cruz. It will open a .docx file, check for guest names and notes, and write each guest's name and notes into a separate .docx file.


Draft of steps:
clone/download
sudo pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Before use:
ensure every guest has newline between other guests
ensure name of each guest is bolded
